Now here's a little story I've got to tell <br>
About three bad brothers you know so well
</h3>

<br>


	<h3>MATT</h3>
	FRONT END
<br>
  Born in Las Vegas, after spending time in The Bay Area and Seattle, 
  Matt eventually landed in Denver. New to web development, 
  he intends to make a splash by mastering DOM manipulation and Vanilla JS. 
<br>



	<h3>RJ</h3>
	BACK END 
		<br>
	Trying to learn back end web development. Check back in 6 months.

<br>






	<h3>WILL</h3>
  BOTH ENDS AT ONCE
<br>
	In West Philadelphia, born and raised <br>
	On the playground <br> is where I spent most of my days <br>
	Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin' all cool
